      <p class="bioText">I am a master's student in urban planning at the <a href="http://www.arch.columbia.edu/"> Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP)</a> at Columbia University. My area of interest is transportation and I hope to have a career planning and delivering public transport improvements in cities that need them. I've worked to get involved with transportation issues by interning at Swiss rail planning agencies like <a href="http://www.sbb.ch/en/home.html">SBB</a>, and <a href="http://www.sma-partner.com/en/">SMA und Partner</a>. I've also spent time interning at more traditional urban planning and design organizations including <a href="http://www.arup.com/">Arup</a>, <a href="http://www.shoparc.com/">SHoP Architects</a> and <a href="https://www.philadelphiaredevelopmentauthority.org/">the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority</a>. Outside of planning, I enjoying basketball, travel, and skiing in my home country <a href="http://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/home.html">Switzerland</a>.</p>
